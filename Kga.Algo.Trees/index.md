# Kga.Algo.Trees Documentation
This site documents all data structures within the **Kga.Algo.Tree** package.
## Data Structures:
1. **TrieMap** - A compressed tree of keys and their respective values. As the name suggests, it uses a Trie data structure that supports fast key/value lookups and efficient prefix search of all key entries within the collection.

2. **TrieSet** - A compressed tree of keys and uses **TrieMap** under the covers.
